# Sokushi Spyware

Sokushi Spyware, developed by A1SBERG, is a potent surveillance tool that establishes a remote connection between the victim's system and the attacker's server. The spyware discreetly extracts critical system information from the infected machine and streams live video from the victim’s webcam back to the attacker, effectively enabling full remote monitoring.

## Features

- **System Information Extraction**: Captures and sends critical system details, including OS, architecture, MAC address, and public IP.
- **Live Webcam Streaming**: Continuously streams live video from the victim’s webcam to the attacker.
- **Connection Persistence**: Automatically attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost.
